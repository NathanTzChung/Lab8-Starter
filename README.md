Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they somewhat complement each other. Specifically, graceful degradation focuses on keeping the functionality of a browser/website available even in cases where more advanced features and technologies are not available. Service workers allows for offline experiences using a website's cache without having to rely on the network. Now then, if network connectivity is poor, then cached content and data is still available (via service workers). At the same time, graceful degradation ensures that the main functionality of the website is still available to be used in which it can use the cached content saved by the service workers. Basically, the two work together to make sure that a page's main purpose and content works even when the bare minimum to get the page open is available.
